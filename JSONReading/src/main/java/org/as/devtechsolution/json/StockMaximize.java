/**
 * Your algorithms have become so good at predicting the market that you now
 * know what the share price of Wooden Orange Toothpicks Inc. (WOT) will be for
 * the next N days.
 * 
 * Each day, you can either buy one share of WOT, sell any number of shares of
 * WOT that you own or not make any transaction at all. What is the maximum
 * profit you can obtain with an optimum trading strategy?
 * 
 * Input
 * 
 * The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow:
 * 
 * The first line of each test case contains a number N. The next line contains
 * N integers, denoting the predicted price of WOT shares for the next N days.
 * 
 * Output
 * 
 * Output T lines, containing the maximum profit which can be obtained for the
 * corresponding test case.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * 1 <= T <= 10 1 <= N <= 50000
 * 
 * All share prices are between 1 and 100000
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
 * 3 3 5 3 2 3 1 2 100 4 1 3 1 2 Sample Output
 * 
 * 0 197 3 Explanation
 * 
 * For the first case, you cannot obtain any profit because the share price
 * never rises. For the second case, you can buy one share on the first two
 * days, and sell both of them on the third day. For the third case, you can buy
 * one share on day 1, sell one on day 2, buy one share on day 3, and sell one
 * share on day 4.
